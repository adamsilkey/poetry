# Grief

Grief is the willow, grief is the rain.
Grief is the sunset, grief is the wave.

Grief is the shadow through dim window pane.
Grief is the sunlight that hangs over grave.

Grief is the stillness at late evening hours.
Grief is the laughter in warm winter showers.

Grief is the table with one empty chair.
Grief is the theater, the restaurant, the car rides, the faire.

Grief is the love and the sorrow, the joy and the pain.
Grief is the willow, grief is the rain.
